The blue icon opens a fresh Google Doc, and the green one opens a fresh Google Sheet.

### How to use

1. Clone this repo (or just download the .zip).
2. Put it somewhere permanent (just don't delete it later, or it'll stop working).
4. In Chrome, ensure your Bookmarks bar is showing (Cmd + Shift + B).
3. Open the folder you just downloaded (in Finder).
4. Drag the `docs.html` file to your Bookmarks bar.
5. Drag the `sheets.html` file to your Bookmarks bar.
6. For each new bookmark: Right-click on it, then click edit, then delete the "Name" field. (You may also need to click it once to get the favicon to show up.)
7. Enjoy!
